### TextMate Theme for Datalog (DES)

This is a TextMate Theme for Datalog. Simply import the `.tmLanguage` file into any of your text editors that support TextMate themes.

A `.tmPreferences` file is also included. If you import this, it allows comments to be inserted via the general shortcut in the text editor.

####Sublime Users
Download the `.zip` file and copy the contents of the folder into your `Packages/User` directory. Then simply restart Sublime.

### Snippets

I have also included some basic Sublime Text 2 snippets, for building basic rules and predicates. By default, the command to trigger the `rule` snippet is `ru` and `pr` for the `predicate` snippet.
